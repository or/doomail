A collection of configurations and scripts to sync IMAP servers to a local
directory and read/send email via (Doom) Emacs.

** Requirements
- isync (can be installed via brew)
- notmuch (can be installed via brew)
- babashka (can be installed via brew)
- [[https://github.com/matryer/xbar][xbar]] [[https://github.com/matryer/xbar/releases/tag/v2.1.7-beta][v2.1.7 beta]] at time of writing
** Installation
*** xbar
Symlink the files in xbar-plugins into =~/Library/Application
Support/xbar/plugins= and start xbar.
*** Doom Emacs
- symlink =lib/ormail= into your doom directory and add =(load!
  "ormail/ormail")= to your =config.el=
*** isync
The best way is to retrieve credentials via macOS Keychain, use the
=UseKeychain= setting for that, see [[https://www.mankier.com/1/mbsync][mbsync man page]] for details.
